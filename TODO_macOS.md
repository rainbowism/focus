# TODO macOS
In order of priority:

1. Data Security & Stability
    - Closing Focus with unsaved files will (a) not ask you if you'd like to save them and (b) put the app in a state that requires a Force Quit.

2. Visual Glitches
    - IBeam cursor does not reset to Normal when hovering over the window title bar or bottom filename/line/col bar

3. Would Be Nice Eventually
    - Smooth Mac-style inertia scrolling
